## Environment Variables

Some APIs require additional data to authenticate or connect to your app. You may need a custom API key to pass to the API, along with users’ authentication credentials. Or you might want to set a sub-domain, role, user permissions, or other API configurations differently for your beta integration and live, active versions of your integration.

Zapier’s environment variables let you set these on a per-version basis for your app. Much like in local development environments such as the one in [Zapier’s CLI developer platform](https://zapier.github.io/zapier-platform-cli/#environment), environment variables store key and value pairs outside of your app’s API calls. Instead of hardcoding critical, secret values into your API authentication, trigger, and action calls, it’s best to add them as environment variables in your app’s _Advanced_ settings, then reference the environment variable in your API calls.

> **Tip**: Zapier’s built-in OAuth v2 Authentication automatically includes client ID and client secret fields, for two of the most commonly used environment variables. Only use the custom environment variables for other variables.

### How to Add Environment Variables

![Zapier Environment Variables](https://cdn.zappy.app/52c80699c321084eaaf7b387c47bd438.png)
_Add any environment variables you need in key and value pairs_

To add environment variables, open your integration in Zapier visual editor and select the _Advanced_ tab in the left sidebar. There you can add your environment variables including a key and a value for each. Click _Add_ to include additional environment variables, or click the `x` icon to remove variables if needed.

### How to Reference Environment Variables

![Use Zapier Environment Variable](https://cdn.zappy.app/226591ede97cbcde75481b38fa0cd64f.png)
_Use environment variables in Zapier’s API call forms or in custom code_

The easiest way to use environment variables in any Zapier integration API call is through the _Request Body_ form. Add your API URL, then click the _Show Options_ link and select _Request Body_ to see the data Zapier will send to your API. Add a new row, then enter your environment variable key as your API expects, then reference the environment variable in Zapier with the following text, replacing `YOUR_KEY` with your actual key:

{% raw %}`{{process.env.YOUR_KEY}}`{% endraw %}

Zapier will then replace that variable with the value for that key from your _Advanced_ settings—and will use the correct value every time if you change it in the future.

You can reference environment variables directly in your API calls the same way—though it’s best practice to include them in Zapier’s default request body instead. You can also reference them in custom code if you switch your API call to code mode.

### How to Change Environment Variables

_You can change environment variable values, but not the original keys_

Need to change your environment variables for a new version of your integration, or before releasing your beta integration to the public? Open the _Advanced_ page in Zapier visual editor, and this time edit the text in the _Values_ column with the new variable values. You cannot edit the keys.

If you need to change a key and its value, first delete the old key, then add a new one instead.

## Computed Fields

![Zapier Computed Fields](https://cdn.zappy.app/f1871d440aeaa77b66a52a2e42d48d98.png)

When adding an input field in your integration's authentication, Zapier includes a _Field Type_ option with two field options: _Field_ and _Computed Field_. The former is a standard input field much like those in the trigger and action [input designer](https://platform.zapier.com/docs/input-designer), where users enter info needed for authentication.

> **Note:** Only use Computed Fields with Session and OAuth v2 authentication.

Computed Fields, on the other hand, store values returned by your integration's authentication response, so they can be referenced in subsequent API calls. Use the same field key as the name your API uses for this field.

Zapier stores all fields returned by the authentication process. Computed fields are marked as _required_, so Zapier watches specifically for those fields in the response data. If the auth process does not return fields marked as computed fields, Zapier will show an error.

For example, when using OAuth v2 authentication, Zapier will store all fields returned by the `getAccessToken` request. If an access token is not included in the response, or any computed fields are missing, it will show an error. You could therefore use a computed field to reference a value that the `getAccessToken` call returns if you need to use it in subsequent API calls.

You can reference the field in any subsequent API call from your integration from the input bundle with the following text, replacing `field` with your field key:

{% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.field}}`{% endraw %}

### How to Use a Field From the Test API Call as a Computed Field?

Zapier stores every field from the core API authentication calls in OAuth v2 and Session auth, but does not store the responses from the test API call. If you need to use the data from a test API call later in your Zapier integration, you need to instead have Zapier call that API endpoint as part of your Token Exchange Endpoint or Authorization URL code.

To do that, use the _Code Mode_ option and [add custom code](./faq#how-does-code-mode-work) to have Zapier call both the URL needed for the authorization step and your test API call. You can then include computed fields for data returned from either API call and reference them in later steps.

## Zapier Data Bundles

Zapier stores data from users' authentication and input forms for API calls in the `bundle` object. You can reference that data in your integration using {% raw %}`{{bundle.bundleName.field}}`{% endraw %} text in API requests and connection labels, replacing `bundleName` with the bundle name and `field` with the input field key or API response field key you need. You can also reference bundles in custom code if you switch to [Code Mode](/faq#how-does-code-mode-work) for a request, using the same name but without the curly brackets, for example `return bundle.bundleName.field;` to have JavaScript code return a specific field.

If an API response includes a nested field, you can reference it as `field.nestedfield`, for example {% raw %}`{{bundle.inputData.data.name}}`{% endraw %} to reference a `name` nested field inside the `data` field.

Zapier integrations include the following bundles:

### authData

Referenced with: {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.field}}`{% endraw %}

Includes data users enter into the authentication input form, including the `username` field for [Basic Auth](https://platform.zapier.com/docs/basic) and any other field added to the authentication input form with other authentication methods. Additionally, with OAuth v2, Session Auth, and Digest Auth, `authData` includes all data returned by the Token Exchange Endpoint url, referenced with the following, replacing `field` with the field name from your API response:

{% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.field}}`{% endraw %}

For example, the Access Token value will often accessed via {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.access_token}}`{% endraw %} or {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.accessToken}}`{% endraw %}.

However, note that the `authData` bundle does not support nested objects: all values returned from auth functions need to be at the top level. This bundle also does not include values provided by intermediate steps in OAuth2 or Session auth flows, like `redirect_uri`.

Commonly used authData fields include:

- Username: {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.username}}`{% endraw %}
- Password: {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.password}}`{% endraw %}
- Access Token: {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.access_token}}`{% endraw %} or {% raw %}`{{bundle.authData.accessToken}}`{% endraw %}

### inputData

Referenced with: {% raw %}`{{bundle.inputData.field}}`{% endraw %}

In authentication configuration, including connection labels, `inputData` contains the fields returned from the test API call, as well as some values provided by intermediate steps in more complex auth flows, such as the OAuth 2 `redirect_uri`. Values returned by the test API call are typically used to add a [connection label](./auth#label) to new integration connections.

In triggers and actions, `inputData` contains the data that users enter into the input forms, with {% raw %}`{{curlies}}`{% endraw %} (mapped fields from previous Zap steps) rendered with their raw data. Zapier passes these inputs to the app for use with that trigger or action.

If you want the input field data with the original {% raw %}`{{curlies}}`{% endraw %} and not the data from previous steps, use {% raw %}`{{bundle.inputDataRaw.field}}`{% endraw %} instead.

Commonly used inputData fields include:

- Zapier Redirect URI: {% raw %}`{{bundle.inputData.redirect_uri}}`{% endraw %}
- Authorization Code: {% raw %}`{{bundle.inputData.code}}`{% endraw %}

### rawRequest and cleanedRequest

> Note: `bundle.rawRequest` and `bundle.cleanedRequest` are only available in the `perform` for webhooks and `getAccessToken` for OAuth.

Referenced with: {% raw %}`{{bundle.rawRequest}}`{% endraw %} or {% raw %}`{{bundle.cleanedRequest.field}}`{% endraw %}

Includes the raw or cleaned info, respectively, from the HTTP request that triggered the `perform` method, or from the user's browser request that triggers the `getAccessToken` call from OAuth v2 authentication. You can reference individual fields with `cleanedRequest`.

Use `bundle.rawRequest` if you need access to header data. In `bundle.rawRequest`, headers other than `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` will be prefixed with `Http-`, and all headers will be named in Camel-Case.

### targetUrl

Referenced with: {% raw %}`{{bundle.targetUrl}}`{% endraw %}

In triggers using REST hooks, this returns the URL a site should send data to, such as `https://hooks.zapier.com/1234/abcd`.

### subscribeData

Referenced with: {% raw %}`{{bundle.subscribeData}}`{% endraw %}

In triggers using REST Hooks, this includes the data from the `performSubscribe` function, which is used if you need to send a `DELETE` request to your server to stop sending webhook data to Zapier when the user turns off a Zap.

### process.env

Referenced with: {% raw %}`{{process.env.field}}`{% endraw %}

Commonly used process.env fields include:

- Client Secret: {% raw %}`{{process.env.CLIENT_SECRET}}`{% endraw %}
- Client ID: {% raw %}`{{process.env.CLIENT_ID}}`{% endraw %}
