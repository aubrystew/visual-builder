_Add your app's name, logo, description, and category before building a Zapier integration_

Start by making a new integration.

Open the [Zapier Platform Visual Builder](https://developer.zapier.com/){:target="_blank"} and click _[Start a Zapier Integration](https://developer.zapier.com/app/new){:target="_blank"}_. Add a name for this example integration like `My GitHub Example`, then add a description and a logo, perhaps GitHubâ€™s for this example integration. Below that, answer a few questions about the integration, then click create.

Well done! Now, let's make this new integration do some stuff.
