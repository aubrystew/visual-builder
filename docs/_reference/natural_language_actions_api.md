# AI Actions

Zapier’s [AI Actions](https://actions.zapier.com/) is an AI alpha product designed to work with natural language-based products. It leverages the Zapier platform, with over [6000 apps](https://zapier.com/apps). You can include the capabilities of Zapier’s platform in your own product.

- Access Zapier’s platform of 6000+ apps within your own product.
- Integrate with chatbots or [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).
- Power any integration project.
